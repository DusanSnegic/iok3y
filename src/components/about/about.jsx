                    <p>We are Degen investors whoâ€™ve been rugged countless times before we decided to put an end to malicious contract draining codes by sneaky devs. We create our projects with the best interest of our investors in mind. (And we make good money with the dev fees anyway)</p>

                    <h2 className="sub-title">GIVING POWER BACK TO THE INVESTOR</h2>
                    <p>Mechanics alone make a project last dev interference should not be allowed everyone should have an equal opportunity to make gains (F*ck VIP Culture)</p>
                </div>
                <p>DeFi is inherently risky, invest only what you can afford to lose. Out projects are designed for sustainability and stability, but keep an eye on the pool. At some point the contract will run dry. And then we move on the next one!</p>
